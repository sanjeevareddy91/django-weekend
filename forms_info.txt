In DJango We have 3 Ways of forms creation.

    # 1) Model Forms -- Where data saving and fields validationw will be done based on the models itself.
    # 2) Normal Forms -- Where new form is defined and the data will be saved by using the manual logics.
    # 3) Html Forms -- Normal way of creatin the html and saving the info..

# crispy_forms -- Bootstrap module for adding the UI for the Django Forms.

# pip install django-crispy-forms
